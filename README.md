# How was it developed?

The app was developed to train some react concepts, such as Hooks, component tree, props, state immutability, context and component lifecycle.


# Tools used

React (Hooks, ContextAPI)
Typescript
Styled Components
Mirage JS (Fake API)
Axios


# Running or changing the project

The app can only run locally in a development environment, due to the limited functionality of the MirageJS library. To run the project, just clone the repository, have node v18 and the Yarn package installed and run the command:

```
yarn start
```
